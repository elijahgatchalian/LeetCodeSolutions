 more connected land cells).

 The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water
 around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is
 rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline - Medium

 In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a
 building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of
 buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings).
 Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.

 At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e.
 top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original
 grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the
 buildings when viewed from a distance.

 See the following example.

 What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

 Example

 grid:
 3 0 8 4
 2 4 5 7
 9 2 6 3
 0 3 1 0

 The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
 The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

 gridNew:
 8 4 8 7
 7 4 7 7
 9 4 8 7
 3 3 3 3
 
 Output: 35

 Notes:
 - 1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50
 - All heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100]
 - All buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell, that is, they are 1 x

              its maximum possible height so that the skyline remains the same
              when viewed from top to bottom and left to right
     Input:
        - grid: A 2D vector of integers representing a grid
        - topBottom: A vector of integers of the maximum value a point can be
                     when looking at the grid from top to bottom
        - leftRight: A vector of integers of the maximum value a point can be
                     when looking at the grid from left to right
        - size: An integer representing the size of a row/column in the grid
     Output: An integer of the total increase of each building in the grid
    */
